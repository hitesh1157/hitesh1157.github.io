Hi. My name is Hitesh Kumar as is obvious. I am a final year undergraduate student at IIT Kanpur. Although my major is Aerospace Engineering, but my main focus is Programming. I absolutely love it in any form. I am interested in Algorithms, Distributed Systems, Mobile Application Development and DevOps.

This blog is a collection of ideas, implementations, notes and shit that I do.
